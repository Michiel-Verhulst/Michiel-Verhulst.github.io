                        <p>g my internship, I undertook the task of revamping the 'Observatoire' application, which
                            primarily focused on managing document descriptions and their underlying structures. This
                            comprehensive project encompassed redefining the document and structure hierarchies, as well
                            as the associated data migration and website development.</p>
                        <p>Using ViteJS for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend, I embarked on a journey
                            spanning approximately 10 weeks. The initial phase involved an in-depth analysis of the
                            existing application and its database structure, laying the foundation for subsequent tasks.
                        </p>

                            cover band based in Aarschot, Belgium.</p>
                        <p>The website functioned as a pivotal hub for the band, offering a showcase for their diverse
                            musical repertoire, including songs from artists such as 'De Kreuners,' 'The Scene,'
                            'Nathaniel Rateliff,' 'Rolling Stones,' 'Ficher Z,' and 'The Cure.'</p>
                        <p>In addition to highlighting their music, the site provided essential information about
                            upcoming performances, allowing fans to stay updated with the band's schedule.</p>

                        <p>The internship within the IT programs at UCLL spans over several weeks. At the beginning of
                            the internship, students receive a task within the field of work, which they then carry out
                            over the course of several weeks. At the end, the process is summarized in an internship
                            report.</p>
                        <p>The goal of an internship is to provide students with the opportunity to apply what they have
                            learned throughout their education in a realistic work environment, within an existing IT
                            team. To facilitate this integration, it is important for students to regularly seek
                            feedback on their performance.</p>
                        <p>Two individuals are involved in guiding the student: the internship mentor (from the company)
                            and the internship supervisor (lecturer). Both individuals should be involved in the
                            feedback loop, although it often proves difficult due to their hectic schedules and
                            preference for technical discussions rather than professional skills. However, it is
                            precisely these professional skills that are crucial to further develop.</p>
                        <p>The process that enables students to receive feedback can be improved. It's up to you to
                            create an application for this purpose</p>

                        <p>The project I worked on during my second year at UCLL was a web application available on
                            mobile devices. The application aimed to connect various providers, including IMEC,
                            KULeuven, and the City of Leuven, with three different types of users: Vites for furniture,
                            Materialenbank for construction materials, and Scholen 20-30 for educational materials.</p>
